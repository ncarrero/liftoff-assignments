# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview: In 1-2 paragraphs, provide elevator pitch for project.  This should be high-level overview of your idea, in non-technical language.
### What will your app do?  What might users find useful about it?  Where did the idea come from?
The idea for this project came from the LA fitness mobile app.  I currently go their fitness classes and have tried to keep track of which classes I enjoyed the most and with which instructors.  I noticed that there was a place to heart classes that you liked on the app, but no way to track them.  My app will not only track what classes the user has taken and liked, it will also be able to give the user data on which classes have already been taken, the total amount of calories burned, how many classes
have been taken at the same location, how many classes have been taken with the same instructor, and more.  Users will be able to get all the information they need in my workout data application.  My goal is to improve the LA fitness app by utilizing the data so that it can help the user determine healthy workout habits, keep track of workouts that were the most enjoyable, and which workouts burned the most calories.
### Features: List 3-5 features that you will implement in your project.  Each feature should have a name and 1-2 sentence description.
- User Login: Users will be able to create their own personal account and log in to the application to document progress.  Each user will have a profile page displaying the appropriate data.
- Search: Users will be able to search for classes they have taken based on class name / type, location, instructor, or whether or not they liked the class.
- Create Workout: Users will be able to create a new workout once they are logged in.  They will input the date, time, class name / type, calories burned, location, instructor, and whether or not they liked the class.  Most recent workouts (within a seven day period) will appear on the user's profile.
- Data Profile: Users will be able to see data based on their individual workout progress, such as how many calories they have burned, how many times they have visited a certain location, how many classes of a certain type they have taken, and how many times they liked a specific class.  This will be adjusted based on weekly, biweekly, and monthly progress.
- Edit: Users will be able to edit their entries in case they have made an error while putting in workout information.
- Remove: Users will be able to remove a workout entry if they decided not to complete that workout.
### Technologies: What languages and technologies will you use to build your application?
- C# with .NET
- Razor Templates
- SQL Server Database
- .NET MVC Framework
- Bootstrap for HTML
### What I'll Have to Learn: In the course of the project, you'll have to learn something new.  Name technology or ectechnique you'll have to learn, otherwise describe a problem that you've identified that you don't currently know how to solve.
- I will have to learn how to utilize the user login code to allow only users who input their data to see only their data. In addition, I will need to determine the appropriate ways of querying data and manipulating that data to return back to the user in a way that will be beneficial to them.
- In the future, I would like to be able to automatically add the class data from the LA fitness app or other similar fitness apps.
- In the future, I would like to be able to connect data from fitness watches and update information from there rather than user manually inputting into database.
- In the future, I would like to be able to connect to Google Maps to show which locations the user has already been to and which classes the user has been to there.
- In the future, I would like to be able to also add workouts that were not hosted by the respective gym (such as workouts the user has completed on his or her own).
